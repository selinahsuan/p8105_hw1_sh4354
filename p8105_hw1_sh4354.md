**PROBLEM 1**

``` r
library(moderndive)

library(tidyverse)
```

Load dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Set dataframe

``` r
df=early_january_weather 
```

The 15 variables in this dataset are origin, year, month, day, hour,
temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure,
visib, time_hour. Some important variables include origin and time_hour,
which show that recordings were made every hour from Jan 1, 2013 to Jan
15, 2013 at weather station EWR.

The number of rows in the dataset is 358.

The number of columns in the dataset is 15.

The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

Make scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_sh4354_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

The scatterplot shows that from Jan 1, 2013 to Jan 15, 2013, temperature
increases as date and hour of the recording increases. Humidity also
increases as as date and hour of the recording increases.

Save scatterplot to project directory

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf")
```

**PROBLEM 2**

Create dataframe

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, sd=1),
  vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(rep(c("Level1", "Level2", "Level3"), length.out = 10))
  )
```

Find means of each variable in p2_df

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.5721071

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_char))
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_factor))
```

The code does not work when trying to determine the means of the
character vector and factor vector.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_factor))
```

The code does not work when trying to convert the character vector and
factor vector to numeric vectors. This is because the logical vector
contains numeric values, while the character and factor vectors do not.
Since the character and factor vectors do not contain numeric values,
they also cannot have a mean.
