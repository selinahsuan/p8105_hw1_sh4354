PROBLEM 1

Load library
```{r}
library(moderndive)

library(tidyverse)
```

Load dataset
```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```

Find mean temperature
```{r}
df=early_january_weather
mean(df$temp)
```

There are 15 variables in this dataset, which include origin, year, month, day, hour, and temperature. 
The number of rows in the dataset is `r nrow(early_january_weather)`.
The number of columns in the dataset is `r ncol(early_january_weather)`.
The mean temperature is `r mean(df$temp)`.


Make scatterplot
```{r}
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()

```
The scatterplot shows that temperature increases as POSIXct data increases. In addition, humidity generally increases as both temperature and POSIXct data increases.
